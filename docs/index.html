<h1 align="middle">Overview</h1>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">In this assignment, we explore topics on geometric modeling covered in lecture. In Section 1, we build Bezier curves and surfaces using de Casteljau algorithm.
  In Section 2, we manipulate triangle meshes represented by half-edge data structure, and implement loop subdivision.</span>
</p>
<br>


<h1 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h2>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">de Casteljau's algorithm is used to efficiently evaluate Bezier Curve from control points, it utilized the thought of 
  continuously interpolate the points with parameter t until one point was left, then this point is claimed to be on the Bezier Curve. Each parameter t corresponds
  to one such points, and all such points form the Bezier Curve.
  The implementation is done with this thought. In each iteration, we are given a list of points, then every pi' in the output is derived by doing the interpolation for pi and pi+1, 
  with the given parameter t. </span>
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h2>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">We need to be assure that the movement of points form a curve, and the movement of curve sweeps out a surface.
  Therefore, 2-D Bezier Curves are formed by points moving with different parameters t, then for a surface, which is a 3-dimensional case, Bezier surface
  are spanned by 2-D parameters (u,v). 
  The implementation is done following this instruction. Each 4 control points forms the Bezier curve parametrized by u, we can get 1 point on this Bezier
  Curve after several interpolation repetition. Since we have 4*4 control points, we can get 4 such points, all of which are parametrized by u.
  Then in the last step, we use these 4 points as control points, with parametrization of v, we are able to derive a point that exactly lies on the 
  Bezier Surface.</span>

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">We are required to implement area-weighted normal vectors at vertices. As instructed, we need to find the faces that
  share the given vertex, and we weight its normal by its area. Finally, we normalized the sum of all area-weighted data. The implementation is quite
  analogous to the Face::normal() implementation. We find all the faces with the given vertex, the way to do it is quite similar to the printNeighborPositions()
  in the primer. Then we iterate each face and calculates its normal vector, we then weighted-sum them up, and normalize the sum.  </span>

<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h2>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">The concept is quite trivial. Given a pair of triangles (a,b,c) and (c, b, d), a flip operation on their shared edge (b,c) 
  converts the original pair of triangle into new pair (a, d, c) and (a, b, d). The function we implemented takes an EdgeIter that needs to be flipped as 
  input, and outputs itself after flipped.
  The implementation is brute force. Following the instruction, we first draw the diagram before and after the flip, which contains every element of the half-edge data structure, such as 
  halfedges, edges, vertices... We then write down and define every element involves, and their relationship, before the flip. Then, after flipping,
  we relocates pointers of nearly all every element, based on the diagram after the flip as we drawn. The keypoint is to draw the diagram correctly, and 
  don't ignore anyone element (halfedge, vertex, edge...). Since there are too many assignments and pointer reassignment, the most important thing is to be careful when working on stuff like this</span>

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">There are too many assignments and pointer reassignment, I once made a small typo on the
    allocation of face after flipping, which leads to an error that the graph shows some dark holes after flipping, while the flipping seems
    to work correctly. Later on I found it was because I made a typo when dealing with the Face data structure</span>
</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h2>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">The concept is quite trivial. Given a pair of triangles (a,b,c) and (c, b, d), a split operation on their shared edge (b,c) 
    inserts a new vertex m at its midpoint and connects the new vertex to each opposing vertex a and d, yielding 4 triangles. The function we implemented takes an EdgeIter that needs to be split as 
    input, and outputs a vertexIter to the newly inserted vertex.
    The implementation is brute force. Following the instruction, we first draw the diagram before and after the flip, which contains every element of the half-edge data structure, such as 
    halfedges, edges, vertices... We then write down and define every element involves, and their relationship, before the split. Then, after splitting,
    we relocates pointers of nearly all every element, based on the diagram after the flip as we drawn. The splitting operation results in more halfedges, more vertices, more edges and more faces, therefore,
    we need to construct more of them using the methods like newVertex. The keypoint is to draw the diagram correctly, and 
    don't ignore anyone element (halfedge, vertex, edge...). Since there are too many assignments and pointer reassignment, the most important thing is to be careful when working on stuff like this</span></span>

  <span style="color: blue;">Even though the process is tedious and brute force, where we are required to rolocate and manage lots of pointers,
  I think everything goes quite smooth for this problem. I remember when I browse on Ed, one student said we need to initialize the elements after
  we create them using the newVector function, otherwise the program will seg fault. This suggestions enable me to avoid harsh debugging.

<h2 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  <span style="color: blue;">My implementation generally follows what is described in this algorithm, but I did not adopt the recommended approach
  illustrated in this assignment. The algorithm generally consists of 2 steps, one is to subdivide the triangle. The subdivision process can be done by first doing the
  split operation, which splits every edge, then we do the flip on those edges whose vertices are one old and one new. After that, we do the weighted update for
  both old vertices and new vertices.
  In implementation, I first iterate over all edges and do the split on each edge. In order to track which edges are old edge and which are new, I iterate over the 
  edges again on the original mesh, and store the information of old vertices in a vector. Similarly, I store the information of newly formed edges from split in another
  vector. I think this makes flip easier, since flip only performed on those vertices with one old vertex and one new vertex, we can do such checking on the vectors I constructed.
  After that, I do the reweight on vertices. I applied separate algorighthms based on the instructions on old vertex and new vertex (this can also be checked and looked up from the vector). In reweighting, we
  modify the "position" attribute of the vertices.  
  However, unfortunately, I finish implementing my logic, but my approach (different from that recommended by the homework) does not seem to work. The program stuck and stall whenever I press "L" to start... I do a debugging
  and find that the program was in an infinite loop at the very beginning when I call the split function. I currently cannot figure out where is the problem, but I don't think my logic
  is wrong...  Can anyone look at my codes and gives me some suggestion? Thank you!

  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
